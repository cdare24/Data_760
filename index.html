  <h1>Where should new fuel stations be built?</h1>
  <p>From viewing where there are currently wind and solar projects in Kansas we can see that there are not many solar projects in the state.
    Wind is a much more dominant renewable energy, which makes some sense as Kansas is a part of the 'Tornado Alley'. My recommendation is that
  a new fuel station should be built in Ford county. Ford county has the largest number of wind projects ongoing making it a strong choice for 
  connection with clean energy, it has a large population of close to 35,000 people and sees the intersection of 3 major highways. This means
  a fuel station would be able to benefit residents of Ford county and could be used for people who are passing through on multiple highways.</p>
